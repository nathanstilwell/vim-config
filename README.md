# Nathan Stilwell vim config

> This is a Work in Progress

This was originally part of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nathanstilwell/dotfiles), but I decided to cut them up
a little bit.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo somewhere
2. `ln -s ~/[wherever]/vim.dotfile ~/.vim` and `ln -s /[wherever]/vimrc.dotfile .vimrc`
3. Fire up vim and then run `:PlugInstall`
4. Dracula setup instructions are in `vimrc.dotfile`
